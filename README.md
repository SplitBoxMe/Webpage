# SplitBox.me

SplitBox lets you securely share any file for free - and we mean it. Your file will never be stored completely on any server, and not even parts of it will ever leave your device unencrypted. We achieve this by localy encrypting your file using one-time pad, then splitting it up into unusable parts and finally uploading these to your connected cloud services. 
Than means you just need two public cloud spaces and you are ready to share files completly secure.
